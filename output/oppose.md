- Having VAR officials as part of the referee team ensures seamless communication and a unified decision-making process, which is vital in a fast-paced game like football. Integrating VAR officials with the on-field referees helps maintain consistency and coherence in interpreting rules during the match.  
- VAR officials who are part of the referee team have firsthand knowledge of the match context, including the flow of the game and player behaviors, allowing for more informed and nuanced decisions than completely detached neutral parties could provide.  
- Keeping VAR within the referee team fosters a shared sense of responsibility and accountability, reducing chances of conflicting decisions or delays due to fragmented authority between separate entities. This unified structure helps make the review process more efficient and credible.  
- The Premier League’s current model, where VAR officials are part of the referee team, helps preserve the referee’s authority on the pitch by supporting rather than undermining their decision-making role, respecting the integrity and flow of the game more effectively than external reviewers might.  
- Neutral organizations or individuals may lack experience and deep understanding of Premier League refereeing standards and pressures. Having VAR officials embedded within the referee team allows for specialization and training focused specifically on the league’s unique demands, resulting in higher-quality officiating overall.
