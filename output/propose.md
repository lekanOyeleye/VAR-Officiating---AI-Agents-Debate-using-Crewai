- **Eliminates Conflicts of Interest**: By having VAR officials from neutral organizations or individuals outside the referee team, there is a clear separation that reduces potential bias. Referees who have officiated on the pitch may have subconscious loyalty or pressure, whereas neutral parties focus solely on objective review without prior involvement.

- **Enhances Transparency and Trust**: Neutral VAR officials provide an independent viewpoint, boosting the credibility of decisions. Fans, clubs, and players are more likely to trust call outcomes if they know the reviewing party has no connection to the current referee team or match context.

- **Improves Accountability and Specialization**: Neutral organizations can be held accountable independently of referees, with dedicated experts trained specifically in video analysis and decision-making. This specialization tends to yield higher accuracy and consistent application of rules.

- **Reduces Pressure on On-Field Referees**: Removing VAR from the referee team allows on-field referees to focus entirely on managing the game rather than second-guessing their decisions or managing VAR communications. Neutral VAR officials can provide decisions without internal team dynamics influencing calls.

- **Aligns with Best Practices in Other Sports**: Successful leagues and sports with VAR or video review systems (like tennis, rugby, and cricket) often use independent review officials. Adopting this approach in the Premier League would modernize officiating and foster fairer, unbiased decision-making that enhances overall competition integrity.
