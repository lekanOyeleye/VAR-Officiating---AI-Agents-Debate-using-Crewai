The proposer’s arguments in favor of having VAR officials as neutral organizations or individuals instead of being part of the referee team in the English Premier League are more convincing based on the merits presented. They address fundamental concerns about impartiality, transparency, and specialization in a way that directly impacts the integrity and trustworthiness of match officiating. By separating VAR officials from the on-field refereeing team, conflicts of interest are minimized, which is critical in a high-stakes environment where subconscious loyalties or pressures could impair objective review. The proposer also effectively highlights the benefit of enhanced transparency and trust not only from a spectator perspective but also for clubs and players, which is essential for the acceptance and credibility of decisions made via video review.

Furthermore, the point that neutral VAR officials can focus solely on video analysis, thus increasing accountability and allowing for specialization in this complex role, strengthens their position. This focus could realistically improve accuracy and consistency, aspects that are paramount when implementing technology-driven decision-making. The argument that removing VAR from the referee team reduces the pressure on on-field referees so they can concentrate on managing the game is a practical consideration favoring better performance and reduced mental strain for referees. Also, the proposal’s alignment with best practices seen in other sports with successful video review systems adds a persuasive, evidence-based rationale.

The opposer offers valid points about the advantages of seamless communication, shared responsibility, and contextual awareness when VAR officials are part of the referee team. They stress the importance of maintaining coherence and flow in decision-making, which is crucial in a fast-paced game and could reduce delays and confusion. The concern over neutral officials potentially lacking Premier League–specific experience and understanding also raises an important caveat about quality and league-specific nuances in refereeing style and rules interpretation.

However, these arguments, while important, do not outweigh the core issues of bias risk and transparency inherent in having VAR officials as part of the referee team. The proposer’s arguments confront broader systemic risks to fairness and trust that are foundational to the acceptability of VAR decisions. The opposer’s emphasis on communication and context can be addressed through training, technology, and protocols even with neutral officials, whereas perceived or real conflicts of interest are more difficult to mitigate intrinsically.

In conclusion, the proposer provides a more compelling and comprehensive case for why VAR officials should be completely neutral and independent from the referee team in the Premier League, promoting impartiality, trust, accountability, and alignment with international best practices that can only enhance the quality and integrity of officiating.

Therefore, the side supporting neutral organizations or individuals as VAR officials is the more convincing argument.
